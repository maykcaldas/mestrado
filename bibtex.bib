abstract = {In the molecular dynamics simulation method for fluids, the equations of motion for a collection of particles in a fixed volume are solved numerically. The energy, volume, and number of particles are constant for a particular simulation, and it is assumed that time averages of properties of the simulated fluid are equal to microcanonical ensemble averages of the same properties. In some situations, it is desirable to perform simulations of a fluid for particular values of temperature and/or pressure or under conditions in which the energy and volume of the fluid can fluctuate. This paper proposes and discusses three methods for performing molecular dynamics simulations under conditions of constant temperature and/or pressure, rather than constant energy and volume. For these three methods, it is shown that time averages of properties of the simulated fluid are equal to averages over the isoenthalpic–isobaric, canonical, and isothermal–isobaric ensembles. Each method is a way of describing the dynamics of ...},

abstract = {Multichromophoric dendrimers are increasingly being considered for solar energy systems. To design materials with suitably efficient photon collection demands a thorough understanding of crucial photophysical conditions and electrodynamic mechanisms, many of which prove to emulate photosynthetic systems. Key parameters include the chromophore absorption properties, the generation, branching and folding of the dendrimer, and the presence of a spectroscopic gradient. Driving excitation towards a trap, resonance energy transfer favors migration between nearest neighbor chromophores. In modeling the progress of excitation from antenna chromophores towards the trap, a propensity matrix method has broad applicability, giving physical insights of generic validity. Calculations on specific dendrimers are best served by quantum chemistry models; again, links with photobiological systems can be discerned. Two important optically nonlinear features are cooperative energy pooling, and two-photon energy transfer. Branch multiplicity and the polar or polarizable nature of the chromophores also play important roles in determining energy harvesting characteristics. {\textcopyright} Materials Research Society 2012.},

abstract = {In this paper, a novel heterogeneous nanodendrimer with generation of G2.0 was prepared by individual grafting of diethylenetriamine, triazine and L-cysteine methyl ester on the modified aluminum–silicate mixed oxides as a potent adsorbent of Hg(II) ions from aqueous media. The prepared nanodendrimer was characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum (1H NMR and13C NMR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Diffuse reflectance UV–Vis spectroscopy (DR UV–Vis), zeta potential ($\zeta$), inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nitrogen adsorption experiments at −196 °C and elemental analysis. Equilibrium and kinetic models for Hg(II) ions removal were used by investigating the effect of the contact time, adsorbent dosage, initial Hg(II) ions concentrations, effect of solution's temperature, interfering ions, and initial pH. The contact time to approach equilibrium for higher removal was 6 min (3232 mg g−1). The removal of Hg(II) ions has been assessed in terms of pseudo-first- and -second-order kinetics, and the Freundlich, Langmuir and Sips isotherms models have also been applied to the equilibrium removal data. The removal kinetics followed the mechanism of the pseudo-second order equation, where the chemical sorption is the rate-limiting step of removal process and not involving mass transfer in solution, which was further proved by several techniques such as zeta potential, FT-IR and DS UV–vis. The thermodynamic parameters ($\Delta$G, $\Delta$H and $\Delta$S) implied that the removal of mercury ions was feasible, spontaneous and chemically exothermic in nature between 15 and 80 °C. The nanodendrimer indicated high reusability due to its high removal ability after 15 adsorption–desorption runs. The adsorption mechanisms of Hg(II) ions onto the nanodendrimer was further studied by diverse techniques such as FTIR, EDS, zeta potential, DR UV–Vis spectroscopy and SEM. The possible mechanism of the Hg(II) ions adsorption onto the nanodendrimer could be carried out through the various paths such as electrostatic interaction, complexation, toxic metal chelation and ionic exchange, which eventually resulted in the hydrolysis and precipitation of the adsorbed Hg(II). The L-cysteine methyl ester nanodendrimer could also remove the mercury ions from the Persian Gulf water even after five times of recycling.},

We present theoretical and simulational evidence of how the shape and inner structure of dendrimers depends on the generation number as well as the effective interactions that exist between dendrimers in solution. These approaches based on simplified dendritic structures show there is a tunable and ultrasoft interaction between the centers of the solublized dendrimers. Results from small-angle neutron scattering data confirm the theory and indicate that dendrimers are model systems of ultrasoft colloids that bridge the gap between polymers and hard spheres. Dendrimers can form a class of materials analogous to the related systems of star polymers and block copolymer micelles which exhibit special properties.},

abstract = {Absorption spectroscopy experiments were carried out to examine the 1:1 supramolecular interaction between Eosin Y (EOS) and low generation G0-G3 poly(amido amine) (PAMAM) dendrimers at neutral and basic media, aimed at gaining insight about the role of pH and dendrimer generation on EOS-PAMAM binding. Our results revealed that EOS complexation is favored under neutral pH conditions, and that the supramolecular interaction strengthens as the dendrimer generation increases. Further molecular-level information regarding EOS-PAMAM systems was obtained from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, Non-Covalent Interaction (NCI) analysis and MM/PBSA binding free energy calculations, which were carried out to examine the role of the generation, charge, and protonation state of PAMAM on the structure, conformation, and preferable interactions with EOS at neutral and basic pH conditions. Theoretical predictions were in high agreement with experimental results, showing that neutral pH allows a faster, deeper, and more stable complexation of the dye within dendrimer cavities, and that higher generation dendrimers induce a larger affinity towards EOS. According to MD results, the binding mode of the dye favors the interaction of the xanthene moiety within internal dendrimer cavities through the establishment of attractive van der Waals contacts. On the other hand, the carboxylate moiety interacts with the outermost dendrimer branches and remains exposed towards the solvent in G0-G2 PAMAM. These results support the validity of using MD simulations as auxiliary tools to deal with supramolecular complexation phenomena involving PAMAM dendrimers as host molecules.},

The complex formed by 20 RIF molecules and the dendrimer (RIF{\textless}inf{\textgreater}20{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}-PAMAM) was subjected to 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at two different pH conditions (neutral and acidic). The complex was found to be significantly more stable in the simulation at neutral pH compared to the simulation at low pH in which the RIF molecules were rapidly and almost simultaneously expelled to the solvent bulk. The high stability of the RIF-PAMAM complex under physiological pH and the rapid release of RIF molecules under acidic medium provide an interesting switch for drug targeting since the Mycobacterium resides within acidic domains of the macrophage. Altogether, these results suggest that, at least in terms of stability and pH-dependent release, PAMAM-like dendrimers may be considered suitable drug delivery systems for RIF and derivatives.},

First, sample free energy profiles of NA crossing PAMAM-G3 at pH 6 and 3 were computed using the adaptive biasing force (ABF) method. We found that PAMAM-G3 provides a more appropriate environment for NA inclusion when internal tertiary amine groups are unprotonated (at pH 6). However, when internal tertiary amine groups are protonated (at pH 3), the PAMAM cavities are less hydrophobic; therefore the drug-dendrimer interactions become similar to drug-solvent interactions. Traditional MD simulations were also performed to investigate the structural stability of the PAMAM-NA complexes near the free energy minima at pH 6. We found that association of NA and PAMAM adopts a preferred binding mode around the surface of PAMAM, where hydrogen bond (HB) interactions with the amino and amide NH groups of the nearby monomers are established. These interactions are very stable whether additional van der Waals interactions between pyridine ring of NA and methylene groups of the more external monomers of PAMAM are established. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

The protonation of PAMAM dendrimers first involves protonation of primary amine groups at the outer rim of the dendrimer at high pH, while the tertiary amine groups in the dendrimer core protonate at lower pH. The last group to protonate at low pH is a central tertiary amine.},

abstract = {The shape of dendrimer amphiphiles has an unexpected effect on their self-assembly. A series of diaminobutane poly(propylenimine) generation 3 dendrimer (DAB-dendr-(NH2)(16)) amphiphiles has been synthesized, hearing ail average of five (PD5), three (PD3) and one (PD1) palmitoyl group(s) per dendrimer molecule. Additionally DAB-dendr-(NH2)(16) was derivatized with a layer of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG, degree of polymerization = 12) groups and conjugated to an average of 1 palmitoyl group at the PEG end (PPD1). A Final amphiphile resulted from the conjugation of DAB-dendr-(NH2)(16) with 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-succinimidylpropionate (DSPE-PEG(3400)-SPA), i.e.: DPD5 (with 4 DSPE-PEG arms). The critical micellar concentration in aqueous media followed the trend: DPD5 {\textless} PD5 = PD3 {\textless} PD1 {\textless} PPD1 and amphiphiles eventually formed 10-20 nm monomolecular or multimolecular micelles and/or 200 nm spheres or tubules. Aggregation was entropy driven, as expected, for DPD5, PD5 and PD1 and enthalpy driven with the most hydrophilic Compound PPD1, but was unexpectedly enthalpy driven for PD3. PD3 aggregates formed low capacity hydrophobic domains with a limited capacity for encapsulation of cyclosporine A; encapsulation levels (mole drug per mole polymer) were 0.099, 0.014, 0,099, and 0.735 for PD1, PD3, PD5, and DPD5 and, respectively. We conclude that star shaped amphiphiles such as PD3 are sterically hindered from self-assembling into high capacity hydrophobic domains in aqueous media, Amphiphile-membrane interactions were promoted by hydrophobic groups, but diminished by PEG moieties. DPD5 is the most suitable amphiphile for biomedical applications.},

abstract = {A convergent, multistep protocol was employed for the synthesis of a Janus-type multivalent donor-acceptor system. The synthetic approach is based on a Sonogashira cross-coupling of two differently ferrocene-(Fc) substituted dendrons and a final sixfold [2 + 2] cycloaddition-retroelectrocyclization (CA-RE) reaction with tetracyanoethene, which occurs regioselectively at only one of the rigidly linked dendrons. The structural and optoelectronic properties of the compounds were investigated by X-ray analysis, UV/vis spectroscopy, and electrochemistry. The target Janus-system displays redox-amphoteric behavior. The nonalkynylated Fc end groups in one dendron are readily and reversibly oxidized. The second dendron, in which the terminal Fc-activated alkynes underwent the CA-RE reaction to give tetracyanobuta-1,3-dienes in the final step of the synthesis, undergoes four reversible 3-e(-) reductions in the very narrow potential range of 1 V. A spontaneous intramolecular charge transfer from the donor into the acceptor hemisphere was not observed. Furthermore, the oxidation potential of the Fc donors in one hemisphere is hardly perturbed by the push-pull acceptors in the other, which suggests that electronic communication along the $\pi$-system, with several meta-connectivities, is not efficient. Therefore, the charge-transfer bands seen in the Janus-type system originate from the interaction of the Fc donors with the directly connected tetracyanobuta-1,3-diene acceptors in the same hemisphere.},

DNA is known to form several types of liquid-crystalline phases depending, among other factors, on the polycation structure and charge density. Theoretical studies and simulations have predicted the wrapping of DNA around spherical positively charged polycations. As a potential mimic of the histone octamer or other DNA wrapping proteins, poly(amido amine) generation 6 (PAMAM6) dendrimers have been chosen for our study. The self-assembly of DNA induced by PAMAM6 has been investigated using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) in order to reveal the assemblies' structure dependence on the pH of the environment and dendrimer concentrations. We demonstrate that at pH 8.5 dense phases are formed and characterized by a 2D-columnar hexagonal lattice which is transformed into a 3D hexagonal lattice with increasing dendrimer concentration (charge ratio N/P). Moreover, a systematic analysis of the scattering data collected from diluted samples at pH 8.5 and 5.5 has led us to propose a wrapping scenario of DNA around PAMAM6 at pH 5.5.},

Use of B‐splines in place of Lagrange interpolation leads to analytic gradients as well as a significant improvement in the accuracy. We demonstrate that arbitrary accuracy can be achieved, independent of system size N, at a cost that scales as N log(N). For biomolecular systems with many thousands of atoms this method permits the use of Ewald summation at a computational cost comparable to that of a simple truncation method of 10 {\AA} or less.},

This study calculates sizes, asphericities, and global and external dendrimer density profiles that confirm features previously found in other studies. It is shown that form factors do not change significantly with protonation. Diffusion coefficients, intrinsic viscosities, and Rouse relaxation times are computed as conformational averages. The hydrodynamic properties and their change with protonation are in good agreement with available experimental data. Some differences between the neutral and protonated molecules are noticeable in the case of the relaxation times corresponding to the higher generation numbers (G  {\textgreater}  4). These features indicate that pH may play a role in the internal dynamics of dendrimers. The complex modulus curves have also been computed. When in reduced units to discount size effects, the protonation effect is seen to be very small. (Figure presented.) .},

abstract = {Nanoparticles carrying biologically active functional sets (e.g., targeting moiety, payload, tracer) have potential use in a wide range of clinical applications. Though complex, such constructions should, as far as possible, have a defined molecular architecture and be monodisperse. However, the existing methods to achieve this goal are unsuitable for the incorporation of peptides and proteins, and those that provide for orthogonal introduction of two different types of functional element are incompatible with the use of commercially available materials. In this study, we have developed approaches for the production of nanoparticles based on commercially available polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers. First, we identified an optimized oxime conjugation strategy under which complex dendrimers can be fully decorated not only with model peptides, but also with recombinant proteins (insulin was taken as an example). Second, we developed a strategy based on a two-chain covalent heterodendrimer (a "diblock") based on cystamine core PAMAM dendrimers and used it to generate heterodendrimers, into which a peptide array and a mannose array were orthogonally introduced. Finally, by incorporating a functionalized linker into the diblock architecture we were able to site-specifically introduce a third functional element into the nanoparticle. We exemplified this approach using fluorescein, a mannose array, and a peptide array as the three functionalities. We showed that incorporation of a mannose array into a nanoparticle strongly and specifically enhances uptake by sentinel cells of the immune system, an important property for vaccine delivery applications. These PAMAM dendrimer-based approaches represent a robust and versatile platform for the development of bioactive nanoparticles.},

abstract = {A light-harvesting antenna was made by functionalizing a dendrimer with suitable chromophores. In the dye-labeled dendrimers, light absorbed by the peripheral chromophores is funneled to a central fluorescent core with high efficiency and by a mechanism that is independent of the dendritic architecture. This scheme is reminiscent of photosynthesis, where solar energy absorbed anywhere in an array of hundreds of chlorophyll mols. is efficiently transferred to a single reaction center. The dye-labeled poly(aryl ether) dendrons G1 to G4 were prepd. by nucleophilic attack of coumarin 2 on the benzyl bromide groups of protected monomer; the deprotected phenol was coupled to coumarin 343 to produce the fully dye-labeled first generation dendron. The deprotection and coupling steps were repeated to obtain the G-2 and G-3 dendrons functionalized with both coumarin 2 and coumarin 343. The coupling of the fourth generation phenol to coumarin 343 produced the fully dye-labeled G-4 macromol. The optical absorption of the macromol. at each generation closely matched the sum of contributions of individual fragments; the absorption capacity of the dendrimer increases with the no. of terminal chromophores, and the light-harvesting antenna becomes more and more effective as the dendrimer generation increases. The dendrimers also display efficient energy transfer up to the fourth generation. Almost all of the absorbed energy is used to excite the focal dye and is eventually converted into a single emission spectrum. At high generations (G-3 and G-4), the spatial concn. of energy results in a net fluorescence amplification. This energy transfer provides unprecedented flexibility since any dendritic architecture can, in principle, be used to build this type of photoactive device. [on SciFinder(R)]},

abstract = {A new parameter set (53A6(OXY)) is developed for the GROMOS force$\backslash$nfield, that combines reoptimized parameters for the oxygen-containing$\backslash$nchemical functions (alcohols, ethers, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic$\backslash$nacids, and esters) with the current biomolecular force field version$\backslash$n(53A6) for all other functions. In the context of oxygen-containing$\backslash$nfunctions, the 53A6(OXY) parameter set is obtained by optimization$\backslash$nof simulated pure-liquid properties, namely the density rho(liq)$\backslash$nand enthalpy of vaporization Delta H(vap), as well as sclvation properties,$\backslash$nnamely the free energies of solvation in water Delta G(wat) and in$\backslash$ncydohexane Delta G(che), against experimental data for 10 selected$\backslash$norganic compounds, and further tested for 25 other compounds.

abstract = {This article reports on the calibration and validation of a new GROMOS-compatible parameter set 2016H66 for small organic molecules in the condensed phase. The calibration is based on 62 organic molecules spanning the chemical functions alcohol, ether, aldehyde, ketone, carboxylic acid, ester, amine, amide, thiol, sulfide, and disulfide, as well as aromatic compounds and nucleic-acid bases. For 57 organic compounds, the calibration targets are the experimental pure-liquid density $\rho$ liq and the vaporization enthalpy $\Delta$H vap , as well as the hydration free energy $\Delta$G wat and the solvation free energy $\Delta$G che in cyclohexane, at atmospheric pressure and at (or close to) room temperature. The final root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) for these four quantities over the set of compounds are 32.4 kg m −3 , 3.5 kJ mol −1 , 4.1 kJ mol −1 , and 2.1 kJ mol −1 , respectively, and the corresponding average deviations (AVED) are 1.0 kg m −3 , 0.2 kJ mol −1 , 2.6 kJ mol −1 , and 1.0 kJ mol −1 , respectively. For the five nucleic-acid bases, the parametrization is performed by transferring the final 2016H66 parameters from analogous organic compounds followed by a slight readjustment of the charges to reproduce the experimental water-to-chloroform transfer free energies $\Delta$G trn . The final RMSD for this quantity over the five bases is 1.7 kJ mol −1 , and the corresponding AVED is 0.8 kJ mol −1 . As an initial validation of the 2016H66 set, seven additional thermodynamic, transport, and dielectric properties are calculated for the 57 organic compounds in the liquid phase. The agreement with experiment in terms of these additional properties is found to be reasonable, with significant deviations typically affecting either a specific chemical function or a specific molecule. This suggests that in most cases, a classical force-field description along with a careful parametrization against $\rho$ liq , $\Delta$H vap , $\Delta$G wat , and $\Delta$G che results in a model that appropriately describes the liquid in terms of a wide spectrum of its physical properties.},

The dendrimers were resolved as separate, beam-stable entities, and their sizes and distribution of sizes were statistically analyzed and compared with data from small-angle X-ray scattering in solution. Aqueous G10 dendrimers were also characterized by examination in the frozen, hydrated state after quench-freezing in liquid ethane (cryo-TEM) and the data compared with the results of the staining experiments. To a first approximation, the dendrimers appeared circular in projection and the diameters conformed to a Gaussian distribution which broadened somewhat with increasing generation number. Cryo-TEM, in general, confirmed the staining experiments but suggested that, in the native state, there is more variability in the shapes of the dendrimers, with polyhedral shapes occurring quite frequently.},

Parameters for both torsional and nonbonded energetics have been derived, while the bond stretching and angle bending parameters have been adopted mostly from the AMBER all-atom force field. The torsional parameters were determined by fitting to rotational energy profiles obtained from ab initio molecular orbital calculations at the RHF/6-31G*//RHF/6-31G* level for more than 50 organic molecules and ions. The quality of the fits was high with average errors for conformational energies of less than 0.2 kcal/mol.

abstract = {Interaction between Astramol poly(propylene imine) dendrimers of five generations, DAB-dendr-(NH2)x (where x is equal to 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64) and linear poly(sodium acrylate), poly(acrylic) acid, poly(sodium styrenesulfonate), or native DNA was studied in salt-free solutions by means of potentiometric, argentometric, and turbidimetric titrations. In addition to x outer primary amine groups the dendrimer molecule contains x - 2 inner tertiary amine groups. It is found that the pH-controlled interpolyelectrolyte coupling reaction resulting in formation of the corresponding interpolyelectrolyte complexes occurs on mixing of the dendrimer and the polyanion solutions. A peculiar finding was that all dendrimer amine groups being protonated can form ion pairs with carboxylate or sulfonate groups of the polyanions. In other words DAB-dendr-(NH2)x molecules are fully penetrable for rather flexible oppositely charged polyelectrolyte chains. However, this is not the case for rigid negatively charged DNA double helixes which apparently bind only to the dendrimer shell. The complexes of dendrimers, with polyanions containing equal amounts of cationic and anionic groups mostly ion-paired (stoichiometric complexes), are insoluble in water. At the same time water soluble nonstoichiometric interpolyelectrolyte complexes can be obtained if the dendrimer is a deficient component of the complex species. This behavior is similar to that of complexes formed by oppositely charged linear polyions.},

abstract = {The work-up of chemical reactions by standard techniques is often time consuming and energy demanding, especially when chemists have to guarantee low levels of metal contamination in the products. Therefore, scientists need new ideas to rapidly purify reaction mixtures that are both economically and environmentally benign. One intriguing approach is to tether functionalities that are required to perform organic reactions to magnetic nanoparticles, for example, catalysts, reagents, scavengers, or chelators. This strategy allows researchers to quickly separate active agents from reaction mixtures by exploiting the magnetic properties of the support. In this Account, we discuss the main attributes of magnetic supports and describe how we can make the different nanomagnets accessible by surface functionalization. Arguably the most prominent magnetic nanoparticles are superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) due to their biologically well-accepted constituents, their established size-selective synthesis methods, and their diminished agglomeration (no residual magnetic attraction in the absence of an external magnetic field). However, nanoparticles made of pure metal have a considerably higher magnetization level that is useful in applications where high loadings are needed. A few layers of carbon can efficiently shield such highly reactive metal nanoparticles and, equally important, enable facile covalent functionalization via diazonium chemistry or non-covalent functionalization through $\pi$?$\pi$ interactions. We highlight carbon-coated cobalt (Co/C) and iron (Fe/C) nanoparticles in this Account and compare them to SPIONs stabilized with surfactants or silica shells. The graphene-like coating of these nanoparticles offers only low loadings with functional groups via direct surface modification, and the resulting nanomagnets are prone to agglomeration without effective steric stabilization. To overcome these restrictions and to tune the dispersibility of the magnetic supports in different solvents, we can introduce dendrimers and polymers on Co/C and Fe/C platforms by various synthetic strategies. While dendrimers have the advantage of being able to array all functional groups on the surface, polymers need fewer synthetic steps and higher molecular weight analogues are easily accessible. We present the application of these promising hybrid materials for the extraction of analytes or contaminates from complex aqueous solutions (e.g. waste water treatments or blood analytics), for metal-, organo-, and biocatalysis, and in organic synthesis. In addition, we describe advanced concepts like magnetic protecting groups, a multistep synthesis solely applying magnetic reagents and scavengers, and thermoresponsive self-separating magnetic catalysts. We also discuss the first examples of the use of magnetic scaffolds manipulated by external magnetic fields in flow reactors on the laboratory scale. These hold promise for future applications of magnetic hybrid materials in continuous flow or highly parallelized syntheses with rapid magnetic separation of the applied resins.},

For this purpose, a coarse-grained model for PPI dendrimer is developed and is used to predict the structural properties as a function of PPI core size, such as the size of hybrid dendrimers, the depth of water penetration, the extent of back-folding of their chain terminals, the size and distribution of created cavities, and asphericity. The results show that the location of pyrene in the interior structure of the hybrids is independent of PPI core size and the branching chains create a barrier against the penetrating molecules in the shell of PPI. Then, by adding the PAMAM to the surface of PPI, this barrier is removed, and this will enhance the encapsulation capacity of the hybrid.},

abstract = {Poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers play an important role in drug delivery systems, because the dendrimers are susceptible to gain unique features with modification of their structure such as changing their terminals or improving their interior core. To investigate the core improvement and the effect of core nature on PAMAM dendrimers, we studied two generations G3 and G4 PAMAM dendrimers with the interior cores of commonly used ethylendiamine (EDA), 1,5-diaminohexane (DAH), and bis(3-aminopropyl) ether (BAPE) solvated in water, as an aqueous dendrimer system, by using molecular dynamics simulation and applying a coarse-grained (CG) dendrimer force field. To consider the electrostatic interactions, the simulations were performed at two protonation states, pHs 5 and 7. The results indicated that the core improvement of PAMAM dendrimers with DAH produces the largest size for G3 and G4 dendrimers at both pHs 5 and 7. The increase in the size was also observed for BAPE core but it was not so significant as that for DAH core. By considering the internal structure of dendrimers, it was found that PAMAM dendrimer shell with DAH core had more cavities than with BAPE core at both pHs 5 and 7. Also the moment of inertia calculations showed that the generation G3 is more open-shaped and has higher structural asymmetry than the generation G4. Possessing these properties by G3, specially due to its structural asymmetry, make penetration of water beads into the dendrimer feasible. But for higher generation G4 with its relatively structural symmetry, the encapsulation efficiency for water molecules can be enhanced by changing its core to DAH or BAPE. It is also observed that for the higher generation G4 the effect of core modification is more profound than G3 because the core modification promotes the structural asymmetry development of G4 more significantly. Comparing the number of water beads that penetrate into the PAMAM dendrimers for EDA, DAH, and BAPE cores indicates a significant increase when their cores have been modified with DAH or BAPE and substantiates the effective influence of the core nature in the dendrimer encapsulation efficiency.},

abstract = {We investigated the thermodynamic, structural, and dynamics changes in dendrimer-membrane systems during dendrimer adsorption to biological membrane systems by combining atomistic molecular dynamics simulations with umbrella sampling techniques to understand the atomistic interactions between the dendrimer and biological membranes. An ethylenediamine core polyamidoamine dendrimer (generation 3) with amine terminal groups and both zwitterionic dipalmitoyl-phosphatidyl-choline (DPPC) and anionic palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidyl glycerol (POPG) lipid bilayer membranes were used as the model dendrimer and biological membranes, respectively, in this study. The free energy of the dendrimer adsorption onto two model membranes with different charge states was quantitatively determined. For the zwitterionic DPPC membrane, the dendrimer has a minimum free energy of approximately 50 kcal/mol, which is 15 kcal/mol higher than that observed in previous studies. The dominant contribution to the adsorption potential energy is the van der Waals attraction between the dendrimer and the DPPC membrane. However, the anionic POPG membrane pulls the positively charged dendrimer with an attractive mean force of about 200 pN, finally positioning the dendrimer in the membrane headgroup region. As a result of these strong attractive dendrimer and membrane interactions, the dendrimer structurally undergoes the transition from spherical to a pancake conformation, which slows its lateral mobility, especially in the presence of the POPG membrane. The bilayer lipid membranes are also perturbed by the dendrimer adsorption.},

abstract = {G4 PAMAM dendrimers grafted with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) of different sizes (Mw = 550 and 5000) and grafting densities (12?94{\%} of surface terminals) were simulated using the coarse-grained (CG) force fields previously developed and repara- metrized in this work. Simulations are carried out for G4, G5, and G7 un-PEGylated dendrimers that are either unprotonated, terminally protonated, or protonated on both terminals and interior sites, corresponding to pH values of {\textgreater}10, 7, and {\textless}5, respectively. As protonation increases, simulations show only a small (∼6{\%} for G4 and G5) change of dendrimer radius of gyration Rg and show a structural transition from dense-core to dense-shell structure, both of which are in agreement with recent scattering experiments and all-atom simulations. For the PEGylated dendrimers, the Rg of the fully PEG(Mw = 5000)-grafted dendrimer also agrees well with experiment. Longer PEG chains with higher grafting density yield PEG?PEG crowding, which stretches dendrimer terminals toward water more strongly, leading to larger size and a dense-shell structure of the dendrimer. Long PEG chains at high grafting densities also penetrate into the dendrimer core, while short ones do not, which might help explain the reduced encapsulation of hydrophobic compounds seen experimentally in dendrimers that are 75{\%}-grafted with long PEG's(Mw = 5000). This reduced encapsulation for dendrimers with long grafted PEG's has previously been attributed to PEG-induced dendrimer aggregation, but this explanation is not consistent with our previous simulations which showed no aggregation even with longPEG's but is consistent with the new simulations reported here that show PEG penetration into the core of the dendrimer to which the PEG is attached.},

abstract = {Extensive simulations of PAMAM dendrimer generation 2 were performed at several pH conditions with explicit water molecules, to obtain proper conditions and validity for additional simulations without explicit water. Within the range of validity, simulation without water greatly extends the size and duration of practical simulations. We investigated the effects of long-range interaction parameters such as interaction distance and dielectric constant for molecular dynamics simulations of PAMAM dendrimer without water, concluding that charged dendrimer simulation with distance-dependent dielectric constant but without cutoff distance best mimics explicit water results. Structural variations of PAMAM dendrimers were analyzed as a function of pH and dendrimer generation using MD simulations with these long-range interaction parameters. Globular and loosely compact structures at high pH (10) show conservation of atom density distribution across dendrimer generations. Highly ordered extended structures at low pH (4) present an increasingly hollow interior as dendrimer generation grows, resulting in more open structure which provides easier access by chemical agents. By contrast, significant branch back-folding occurred at neutral pH in addition to major peripheral distribution of the terminal groups, yielding higher interior density in the intermediate radial region between the center and the maximum radius as the generation grows. Higher generation dendrimers provide a cavity surrounded by dense atom populations, producing a more stable agent carrier. Transition to high-density packing occurs between generations 4 and 5. Volume differences between neutral and low pH calculated from RG show a dramatic increase beginning at generation 5.},

Individual dendrimer molecules could be clearly observed in the AFM images, which showed that these dendritic particles appear to be monodispersed, dome-shaped, and randomly distributed on the mica surface. Molecular diameter and height can also be measured from each particle's profile section from the AFM line scans. The diameter and height data were used to calculate the molecular Volume of each single molecule. Absolute molecular weight and polydispersity were then estimated for each dendrimer generation. The calculated molecular weights for G5-G8 were in very good agreement with theoretical values. In addition, lower generation dendrimers, such as G4, were also studied by AFM. Although individual molecules of G4 dendrimer could not be imaged,the surface morphology of G4 dendrimer films on mica at different surface densities was observed by AFM.},

abstract = {The field of drug delivery is advancing rapidly. By controlling the precise level and/or location of a given drug in the body, side effects are reduced, doses are lowered, and new therapies are possible. Nonetheless, substantial challenges remain for delivering specific drugs into specific cells. Computational methods to predict the binding and dynamics between drug molecule and its carrier are increasingly desirable to minimize the investment in drug design and development. Significant progress in computational simulation is making it possible to understand the mechanism of drug delivery. This review summarizes the computational methods and progress of four categories of drug delivery systems: dendrimers, polymer micelle, liposome and carbon nanotubes. Computational simulations are particularly valuable in designing better drug carriers and addressing issues that are difficult to be explored by laboratory experiments, such as diffusion, dynamics, etc.},

abstract = {Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations are used to study generation 5 polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers immersed in a bath of water. We interpret the results in terms of three classes of water: buried water well inside of the dendrimer surface, surface water associated with the dendrimer-water interface, and bulk water well outside of the dendrimer. We studied the dynamic and thermodynamic properties of the water at three pH values: high pH with none of the primary or tertiary amines protonated, intermediate pH with only the primary amines protonated, and low pH with all amines protonated. For all pH values we find that both buried and surface water exhibit two relaxation times: a fast relaxation ( approximately 1 ps) corresponding to the libration motion of the water and a slow ( approximately 20 ps) diffusional component related to the escaping of water from one domain to another. In contrast for bulk water the fast relaxation is approximately 0.4 ps while the slow relaxation is approximately 14 ps. These results are similar to those found in biological systems, where the fast relaxation is found to be approximately 1 ps while the slow relaxation ranges from 20 to 1000 ps. We used the 2PT MD method to extract the vibrational (power) spectrum and found substantial differences for the three classes of water. The translational diffusion coefficient for buried water is 11-33{\%} (depending on pH) of the bulk value while the surface water is about 80{\%}. The change in rotational diffusion is quite similar: 21-45{\%} of the bulk value for buried water and 80{\%} for surface water. This shows that translational and rotational dynamics of water are affected by the PAMAM-water interactions as well as due to the confinement in the interior of the dendrimer. We find that the reduction of translational or rotational diffusion is accompanied by a blue shift of the corresponding libration motions ( approximately 10 cm(-1) for translation, approximately 35 cm(-1) for rotation), indicating higher local force constants for these motions. These effects are most pronounced for the lowest pH, probably because of the increased rigidity caused by the internal charges. From the vibrational density of states we also calculate the enthalpies and entropies of the various waters. We find that water molecules are enthalpically favored near the PAMAM dendrimer: energy for surface water is approximately 0.1 kcal/mol lower to that in the bulk, and approximately 0.5-0.9 kcal/mol lower for buried water. In contrast, we find that both the buried and surface water are entropically unfavored: buried water is 0.9-2.2 kcal/mol lower than the bulk while the surface water is 0.1-0.2 kcal/mol lower. The net result is a thermodynamically unfavored state of the water surrounding the PAMAM dendrimer: 0.4-1.3 kcal/mol higher for buried water and 0.1-0.2 kcal/mol for surface water. This excess free energy of the surface and buried waters is released when the PAMAM dendrimer binds to DNA or metal ions, providing an extra driving force.},

abstract = {We have developed a graphical user interface based dendrimer builder toolkit (DBT) which can be used to generate the dendrimer configuration of desired generation for various dendrimer architectures. The validation of structures generated by this tool was carried out by studying the structural properties of two well known classes of dendrimers: ethylenediamine cored poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer, diaminobutyl cored poly(propylene imine) (PPI) dendrimer. Using full atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulation we have calculated the radius of gyration, shape tensor and monomer density distribution for PAMAM and PPI dendrimer at neutral and high pH. A good agreement between the available simulation and experimental (small angle X-ray and neutron scattering; SAXS, SANS) results and calculated radius of gyration was observed. With this validation we have used DBT to build another new class of nitrogen cored poly(propyl ether imine) dendrimer and study it's structural features using all atomistic MD simulation. DBT is a versatile tool and can be easily used to generate other dendrimer structures with different chemistry and topology. The use of general amber force field to describe the intra-molecular interactions allows us to integrate this tool easily with the widely used molecular dynamics software AMBER. This makes our tool a very useful utility which can help to facilitate the study of dendrimer interaction with nucleic acids, protein and lipid bilayer for various biological applications. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {The structure and dynamics of poly(amido amide) (PAMAM) dendrimers have been of great interest both scientifically and industrially, but such important features as the distributions of atoms, channels, and strain inside these molecules remain unresolved. This paper reports results from systematic investigations of the atomistic structure of ethylenediamine (EDA) cored PAMAM dendrimer up through the 11th generation (294?852 atoms), at which point the strain energy has risen to a point that limits uniform growth of additional layers. Here we report, as a function of generation, structural properties such as radius of gyration, shape tensor, asphericity, fractal dimension, monomer density distribution, solvent accessible surface area, molecular volume, and end group distribution functions, all evaluated from extensive molecular dynamics (MD) at 300 K. We find that the radius of gyration scales as Rg ? N1/3 over the entire range of generations, suggesting rather uniform space filling for all generations. Contrary to common expectation, we find that the outer subgenerations penetrate substantially into the interior of the dendrimer, even for G11. Consequently, the terminal amine groups are distributed throughout the interior, not just on the periphery of the dendrimer. However for G6 through G11 there is a large region of uniform density, supporting the uniform scattering model often used in interpreting the SANS (small-angle neutron scattering) and SAXS (small-angle X-ray scattering) data, which lead to sizes in excellent agreement with the calculations. The calculated single particle form factor approaches that of a sphere as the generation number increases. For the larger generations, we found that the use of continuous configuration biased Monte Carlo (CCBB MC) was essential to construct initial configurations that lead to lower final strain energies.},

The presence of solvent leads to swelling of the dendrimer (by 33{\%} for G5 compared to the case of no solvent). We find that decreasing the solution from high pH (similar to10, no protonation) to neutral (similar to7, only primary amines protonated) to low pH (similar to4, tertiary amines also protonated) changes the radius of gyration of G5 from 21 to 22 to 25 Angstrom respectively. We also report such other structural quantities as radial density, distribution of terminal groups, solvent accessible surface area and volume, shape, and structure factors (to compare. with SAXS and SANS experiments) at various pH conditions. We find. significant back-folding of the outer subgenerations in the interior of the molecules at all levels of pH contrary to original expectations and some SANS experiments but in agreement with other SANS experiments. We find significant water penetration inside the dendrimer, with similar to3 water/tertiary amine for high pH and similar to6 water/tertiary amine for low pH (all for G5). This indicates that the interior of the dendrimer is quite open with. internal cavities available for accommodating guest molecules, suggesting using PAMAM dendrimer for guest-host applications.

This is the first report of such a long MD simulation of a larger generation PAMAM dendrimer including the effect of salt and counterions with explicit water molecules. We find that changing the pH from a high value (approximately 12) to a low value (approximately 3) changes the radius of gyration from Rg = 37.8 to 43.1 A (increasing by 13{\%}). We also find significant back-folding of the primary amines and a large amount of water penetration inside the polymer. The increase in size with decrease in pH is consistent with our earlier studies on G3-G6 and agrees with the Monte Carlo theory by Welch and Muthukumar of G8 (Macromolecules, 1998, 31, 5892) and the experiments on G5 and G8 PAMAM dendrimer by Topp et al. (Macromolecules, 1999, 32, 7232). However, these results disagree dramatically with the interpretations of SANS experiments of G8 PAMAM dendrimers by Nisato et al. (Macromolecules, 2000, 33, 4172) who observe no change in the size of the dendrimer with variations of solution pH and ionic strength. We assume that the disagreement might arise from neglecting nonspherical shape, penetration of water and ions into the core, and aggregation, all of which might depend on pH.},

abstract = {The polyamidoamide (PAMAM) class of dendrimers was one of the first dendrimers synthesized by Tomalia and co-workers at Dow. Since its discovery the PAMAMs have stimulated many discussions on the structure and dynamics of such hyperbranched polymers. Many questions remain open because the huge conformation disorder combined with very similar local symmetries have made it difficult to characterize experimentally at the atomistic level the structure and dynamics of PAMAM dendrimers. The higher generation dendrimers have also been difficult to characterize computationally because of the large size (294,852 atoms for generation 11) and the huge number of conformations. To help provide a practical means of atomistic computational studies, we have developed an atomistically informed coarse-grained description for the PAMAM dendrimer. We find that a two-bead per monomer representation retains the accuracy of atomistic simulations for predicting size and conformational complexity, while reducing the degrees of freedom by tenfold. This mesoscale description has allowed us to study the structural properties of PAMAM dendrimer up to generation 11 for time scale of up to several nanoseconds. The gross properties such as the radius of gyration compare very well with those from full atomistic simulation and with available small angle x-ray experiment and small angle neutron scattering data. The radial monomer density shows very similar behavior with those obtained from the fully atomistic simulation. Our approach to deriving the coarse-grain model is general and straightforward to apply to other classes of dendrimers.},

abstract = {Calculating interactions or correlations between pairs of particles is typically the most time-consuming task in particle simulation or correlation analysis. Straightforward implementations using a double loop over particle pairs have traditionally worked well, especially since compilers usually do a good job of unrolling the inner loop. In order to reach high performance on modern CPU and accelerator architectures, single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) parallelization has become essential. Avoiding memory bottlenecks is also increasingly important and requires reducing the ratio of memory to arithmetic operations. Moreover, when pairs only interact within a certain cut-off distance, good SIMD utilization can only be achieved by reordering input and output data, which quickly becomes a limiting factor. Here we present an algorithm for SIMD parallelization based on grouping a fixed number of particles, e.g. 2, 4, or 8, into spatial clusters. Calculating all interactions between particles in a pair of such clusters improves data reuse compared to the traditional scheme and results in a more efficient SIMD parallelization. Adjusting the cluster size allows the algorithm to map to SIMD units of various widths. This flexibility not only enables fast and efficient implementation on current CPUs and accelerator architectures like GPUs or Intel MIC, but it also makes the algorithm future-proof. We present the algorithm with an application to molecular dynamics simulations, where we can also make use of the effective buffering the method introduces.},

In this formulation the MD cell shape and size can change according to dynamical equations given by this Lagrangian. This new MD technique is well suited to the study of structural transformations in solids under external stress and at finite temperature. As an example of the use of this technique we show how a single crystal of Ni behaves under uniform uniaxial compressive and tensile loads. This work confirms some of the results of static (i.e., zero temperature) calculations reported in the literature. We also show that some results regarding the stress‐strain relation obtained by static calculations are invalid at finite temperature. We find that, under compressive loading, our model of Ni shows a bifurcation in its stress‐strain relation; this bifurcation provides a link in configuration space between cubic and hexagonal c...},

Upon increasing the dendrimer generation, the effective charge obtained from our SANS experiments only shows a small increase in contrast to the nearly exponential increase predicted by a recent atomic simulation. We also find that with the same degree of molecular protonation the specific counterion association, which is defined as the ratio of bound chloride anions to positively charged amines in solutions, is larger for higher-generation PAMAM dendrimer. The associated counterion density also increases upon increasing generation number.},

The forward scattering, d$\Sigma$/d$\Omega$(Q = 0), decreases progressively by increasing dendrimer concentration due to interdendrimer interference, giving rise to a well-defined interference peak. Upon increasing dendrimer concentration, a shift is observed in the peak position, Qmax, with the empirical scaling relation Qmax ∼ $\phi$0.55±0.05, which is significantly larger than that of a simple packing argument Qmax ∼ $\phi$1/3. At high Q values, all data sets collapse to a single curve, indicating that the internal structure of the dendrimers are unaffected by interactions between neighboring molecules. Upon addition of acid, the dendrimers become charged, giving rise to a pronounced interference peak. These Coulomb interactions can be screened by addition of either excess acid or salts.},

The samples under investigation were star-burst polyamidoamine dendrimers with generations g0 to 8 in dilute methanol solutions. A model independent approach employing inverse Fourier transformation and square root deconvolution methods has been used to analyze the SAXS data to obtain the pair distance distribution function p(r) and the radial excess electron density profile  (r). In addition, we formulated a model that takes both the colloidal globular, compact shape with form polydispersity or fuzzy surface as well as the loose, polymeric self-avoiding random walk character of dendrimers into account.With this model we were able to describe the spectra of all dendrimer generations consistently. Parameters discussed as a function of the dendrimer generation are, among others, the correlation length of the density fluctuations blob radius polydispersity s or analogously, the width of the fuzzy surface region 2 , the radius of gyration Rg , the sphere radius Rs , the form f . Both the model-independent approach and the model fits reveal that at least down to the third generation the dendrimers exhibit a rather compact, globular shape. These findings are in agreement with the dynamic results obtained by NSE spectroscopy which probes length scales both larger and much smaller than the dimension of a single dendrimer. The method reveals that the dynamics throughout is dominated by the center-of-mass diffusion—the internal dynamics is suppressed. The diffusion coefficients obtained are close to the values calculated from the Stokes–Einstein relation using the sphere radius Rs determined from the SAXS spectra. Dynamically, the dendrimers behave like ‘‘hard'', solid spheres.},

abstract = {The molecular characteristics of the first five generations of poly(propyleneimine) dendrimers with two different types of end groups have been investigated using small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), viscosimetry, and molecular dynamics simulations. The dimension of the poly(propyleneimine) dendrimers, as measured by both SANS and viscosimetry, increases linearly with the generation number and roughly as M-1/3, where M is the molar mass of the dendrimer. This relationship proves to be independent of the character of the end group and the solvent used and is indicative of a compact (space-filling) structure with a fractal dimensionality of approximately 3. The distinct maximum in the Kratky representation of the scattering data and the observed relation !(i.e., R-eta, similar or equal to root(5/3)R-g) between the hydrodynamic radius R-eta,, and the radius of gyration R-g, are consistent with such a structure. Molecular dynamics simulations for two different solvent qualities are in good accordance with the acquired experimental results. The probability distributions of the amine end groups, based on these simulations, exhibit a substantial degree of backfolding. The corresponding radial density distributions show a constant density plateau and a monotonic decrease of the density toward the exterior of the molecule. The above results indicate that the poly( propyleneimine) dendrimers can be considered as flexible molecules with a relatively homogeneous radial density distribution. This view clearly deviates from both the dense shell and dense core models.},

The valence parameters and atomic partial charges were derived by fitting to ab initio data, and the van der Waals (vdW) parameters were derived by conducting MD simulations of molecular liquids and fitting the simulated cohesive energies and equilibrium densities to experimental data. The combined parametrization procedure significantly improves the quality of a general force field. Validation studies based on large number of isolated molecules, molecular liquids and molecular crystals, representing 28 molecular classes, show that the present force field enables accurate and simultaneous prediction of structural, conformational, vibrational, and thermophysical properties for a broad range of molecules in isolation and in condensed phases. Detailed results of the parametrization and validation for alkane and benzene compounds are presented.},

abstract = {The formation of particulate systems with well-defined sizes and shapes is of eminent interest in certain medical applications such as drug delivery, gene transfection, and imaging. The high level of control possible over the architectural design of dendrimers; their size, shape, branching length/density, and their surface functionality, clearly distinguishes these structures as unique and optimum carriers in those applications. The bioactive agents may be encapsulated into the interior of the dendrimers or chemically attached/physically adsorbed onto the dendrimer surface, with the option of tailoring the carrier to the specific needs of the active material and its therapeutic applications. In this regard, the high density of exo-presented surface groups allows attachment of targeting groups or functionality that may modify the solution behavior or toxicity of dendrimers. Quite remarkably, modified dendrimers have been shown to act as nano-drugs against tumors, bacteria, and viruses. Recent successes in simplifying and optimizing the synthesis of dendrimers such as the 'lego' and 'click' approaches, provide a large variety of structures while at the same time reducing the cost of their production. The reflections on biomedical applications of dendrimers given in this review clearly demonstrate the potential of this new fourth major class of polymer architecture and indeed substantiate the high hopes for the future of dendrimers.},

abstract = {Models consisting of an amine-terminated poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer with and without the presence of a linear poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) chain were studied in aqueous solutions by means of fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Dendrimers of two generations, 3rd and 4th and at different pH conditions were examined, in order to address issues associated with characteristics pertinent to the shape of the dendrimers in the presence or absence of PEO as well as to the volume fraction of the penetrating solvent molecules and counterions as compared to recent experimental studies. In addition, hydrogen-bonding characteristics such as the intensity and the longevity of intra- and intermolecular hydrogen-bonded pairs are examined for the first time in these systems. It was found that the volume fraction of the penetrating solvent molecules increased upon decrease of pH, but no dependence on the size of the molecules was observed. The density of the solvent within the dendritic interior did not exceed that of the bulk, while the corresponding number of counterions entering the dendrimer boundaries exhibited a marked increase between the 3rd and the 4th generation of the dendrimers. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding was favored at high pH conditions, while intermolecular hydrogen bonding between PAMAM and the solvent or the PEO was significantly enhanced upon protonation of the dendrimer's amines. The presence of PEO imparted appreciable changes in the dendrimer's shape particularly in the physiological pH conditions. In addition, it incurred a decrease in intramolecular hydrogen bonding and acted antagonistically to the formation of water/dendrimer hydrogen bonds. The higher degree of hydrogen bonding between PAMAM and PEO was observed at low pH levels, indicating that under these conditions the formed complexes are expected to be more stable. The findings of the present study were found to be in good agreement with the relevant experimental findings where available, thus assessing the role of several structural and conformational details in the manifested behavior and providing further insight of the effects of non-covalent complexation of PAMAM dendrimers with linear poly(ethylene oxide).},

Critical molecular design parameters (CMDPs) such as size, shape, and surface chemistry may be controlled by the reactions and synthetic building blocks used. Starburst dendrimers can mimic certain properties of micelles and liposomes and even those of biomolecules and the still more complicated, but highly organized, building blocks of biological systems. Numerous applications of these compounds are conceivable, particularly in mimicking the functions of large biomolecules as drug carriers and immunogens.

The single particle scattering function, P(q), is used to calculate the structure factor, S(q), of the dendrimer solutions and to evaluate the radius of gyration of the dendrimers in dilute solution giving (DAB-dendr-(PA)32) = 12.4 Angstrom, and DAB-dendr-(PA)64) = 15.6 Angstrom. In each case the segment density in dilute solution is 0.35 g cm-3, leaving a large fraction of the dendrimer volume accessible to solvent. We define the "dilute solution regime" for dendrimers to extend to a concentration where the swollen dendrimer volume fraction first equals the value 0.64, which comes at a dendrimer weight fraction of x = 0.25. At this concentration, the spatial arrangement of the dendrimers can be described as a random close packing. For higher concentrations, the experimental scattering functions appear to be self-similar up to a mass fraction of x = 0.60. These observations are consistent with a model of concentrated dendrimer solutions which assumes that individual dendrimers collapse to maintain a volume fraction of 0.64, which is the volume fraction of random close packing of hard spheres. Preliminary small X-ray scattering data give further evidence of the dendrimer collapse.},

abstract = {Potentiometric titration experiments of poly(propylene imine) dendrimers (up to the fifth generation) were carried out at salt concentrations of 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 M KCl and NaCl. The experiments were performed at two different locations on different instruments and were converted to titration curves using two different methods, resulting in a consistent experimental data set for the dendrimers measured. The titration curves feature two distinct steps around pH 6 and 10 with an intermediate plateau at 2/3 of the total ionizable groups. This protonation pattern reflects short-ranged repulsive interactions between ionizable sites and can be modeled using an Ising model with nearest-neighbour pair interactions. The intermediate plateau results from the stability of an onion-like structure where all odd shells of the dendrimer are protonated, while the even ones remain deprotonated. The Ising model permits a quantitative analysis of the titration curves. For larger dendrimers, this Ising approach is shown to be superior to the classical analysis in terms of successive protonation equilibria. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {A unique asymmetric bow-tie poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer (ABTD) scaffold was designed and developed as a well-defined macromolecular carrier for tumor-targeted drug delivery. The ABTD scaffold in this study consists of a G3-half-dendron (G3-HD) unit and a G1-half-dendron (G1-HD) unit, bearing thiol moiety in each unit and a bis(maleimide) linker unit, which undergo sequential thiol−maleimide coupling to assemble the scaffold. This assembly methodology is applicable to all other combinations of different generations of PAMAM dendrimers. In the prototype ABTD in this study, 16 biotin moieties were tethered to the G3-HD unit and 4 payloads (new- generation taxoid) to the G1-HD via a self-immolative linker to form an ABTD- tumor-targeting conjugate (ABTD-TTC-1). Two other ABTD-TTCs were synthesized, wherein the G1-HD unit was tethered to a fluorescence-labeled taxoid or to a fluorescent probe. These three ABTD-TTCs were constructed by using a common key ABTD 6 bearing a terminal acetylene group in the G1-HD unit, which was fully characterized as a single molecule by high-resolution mass spectrometry and NMR despite its high molecular weight (Mw: 12 876). Then, the click reaction was employed to couple ABTD 6 with a small-molecule payload or fluorescence probe unit bearing a terminal azide moiety. ABTD-TTC-3, as a surrogate of ABTD-TTC-2, showed substantially enhanced internalization into two cancer cell lines via receptor-mediated endocytosis, attributed to multibinding effect. ABTD-TTC-1 exhibited a remarkable selectivity to cancer cells (1400−7500 times) compared to human normal cells, which demonstrates the salient feature and bright prospect of the ABTD-based tumor-targeted drug-delivery system.},

Mutually consistent coarse-grained (CG) models both for PAMAM dendrimers and for dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) lipid molecules are constructed. The PAMAM CG model describes correctly the conformational behavior of the dendrimers, and the DMPC CG model can properly give the surface tension of the amphiphilic membrane. A series of systematic simulations is performed to investigate the binding structures of the dendrimers on membranes with varied length of the hydrophobic tails of amphiphiles. The permeability of dendrimers across membranes is enhanced upon increasing the dendrimer size (generation). The length of the hydrophobic tails of amphiphiles in turn affects the dendrimer conformation, as well as the binding structure of the dendrimer-membrane complexes. The negative curvature of the membrane formed in the dendrimer-membrane complexes is related to dendrimer concentration. Higher dendrimer concentration together with increased dendrimer generation is observed to enhance the permeability of dendrimers across the amphiphilic membranes.},

The application of nanotechnology for anticancer drug delivery is expected to address these issues and bring new hope for cancer treatment. In this context, we established an original nanomicellar drug delivery system based on an amphiphilic dendrimer (AmDM), which could generate supramolecular micelles to effectively encapsulate the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) with high drug-loading capacity ({\textgreater}40{\%}), thanks to the unique dendritic structure creating large void space for drug accommodation. The resulting AmDM/DOX nanomicelles were able to enhance drug potency and combat doxorubicin resistance in breast cancer models by significantly enhancing cellular uptake while considerably decreasing efflux of the drug. In addition, the AmDM/DOX nanoparticles abolished significantly the toxicity related to the free drug. Collectively, our studies demonstrate that the drug delivery system based on nanomicelles formed with the self-assembling amphiphilic dendrimer constitutes a promising and effective drug carrier in cancer therapy.},

With the Lys-bis($\beta$-CDs)-FL complex as an energy donor and mercaptoethylamine (MEA)-modified gold nanoparticles (MGNPs) as an energy acceptor, the two parts assemble an efficient FRET nanoprobe through an amide bond. Trypsin is specific for the hydrolysis of amide linkages of lysine. Therefore, in the presence of trypsin, the nanoprobe is cleaved by trypsin on the binding sites of amide with good specificity and sensitivity, resulting in the fluorescence recovery of the quenched FL. The nanoprobe has good biological applicability and provides a potential assay for further clinical research of trypsin in biosystems. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract = {Based on atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the small angle neutron scattering (SANS) intensity behavior of a single generation-4 polyelectrolyte polyamidoamine starburst dendrimer is investigated at different levels of molecular protonation. The SANS form factor, P(Q), and Debye autocorrelation function, $\gamma$(r), are calculated from the equilibrium MD trajectory based on a mathematical approach proposed in this work. The consistency found in comparison against previously published experimental findings (W.-R. Chen, L. Porcar, Y. Liu, P. D. Butler, and L. J. Magid, Macromolecules 40, 5887 (2007)) leads to a link between the neutron scattering experiment and MD computation, and fresh perspectives. The simulations enable scattering calculations of not only the hydrocarbons but also the contribution from the scattering length density fluctuations caused by structured, confined water within the dendrimer. Based on our computational results, we explore the validity of using radius of gyration R(G) for microstructure characterization of a polyelectrolyte dendrimer from the scattering perspective.},

abstract = {In this work, we use AFM measurements in conjunction with dialysis experiments to study the synthesis mechanism and physical state of dendrimer-stabilized platinum nanoparticles. For characterizing particle size distributions by high resolution transmission electron microscopy and AFM, sample preparation by drop evaporation presumably minimizes the risk of sample bias that might be found in spin coating or dip-and-rinse methods. However, residual synthesis by-products (mainly salts) must be removed from solutions of dendrimer-stabilized metal nanoparticles prior to AFM imaging. Purification by dialysis is effective for this purpose. We discovered, by UV-visible spectrophotometry and atomic absorption (AA) spectroscopy, that dialysis using 'regular' cellulose dialysis tubing (12 000 Da cut-off) used in all previous work leads to substantial losses of poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer (G4OH), PAMAM-Pt(+2) complex, and PAMAM-stabilized Pt nanoparticles. Use of benzoylated dialysis tubing (1200 Da cut-off) shows no losses of G4OH or G4OH-Pt mixtures. We use AFM to see whether selective filtration during dialysis introduces sampling bias in the measurement of particle size distributions. We compare results (UV-visible spectra, AA results, and AFM-based particle size distributions) for a sample of G4OH-Pt(40) divided into two parts, one part dialysed with regular dialysis tubing and the other with benzoylated tubing. Exhaustive dialysis using benzoylated tubing may lead to the loss of colloidal Pt nanoparticles stabilized by adsorbed dendrimer, but not Pt nanoparticles encapsulated by the dendrimer. The comparisons also lead to new insights concerning the underlying synthesis mechanisms for PAMAM-stabilized Pt nanoparticles.},

abstract = {Mesoporous silica carriers are emerging as therapeutic drug delivery systems. The objective of this study was to develop a formulation for synthesizing silica-PAMAM dendrimer hybrid nanoparticles with sol-gel technique. Subsequently, black carrot anthocyanins were encapsulated and investigated for their capability in terms of inhibiting the proliferative effects of neuroblastoma (Neuro 2A). In this context, particle size distributions were ascertained followed by thermal analysis (DSC), scanning electron microscopy and encapsulation efficiency. Subsequently, in vitro release kinetics was determined along with cytotoxicity of empty and anthocyanin doped hybrid nanoparticles. The lowest particle size was 134.8 nm with a zeta potential of +19.78 mV which enhanced electrostatic interaction with the cell membrane in the cytotoxicity analyses. As the anthocyanin content was totally released at the end of 6 days, the cytotoxicity was observed for 134 h, reaching an inhibition of 87.9{\%}. On the other hand, Neuro 2A cells incubated with empty nanoparticles exhibited a high proliferation indicating that hybrid nanoparticles were not toxic to the cells and the inhibitory effect was associated with the anthocyanins.},

These vesicles, denoted onion-like dendrimersomes, are assembled by simple injection of a solution of Janus dendrimer in a water-miscible solvent into water or buffer. These dendrimersomes provide mimics of double-bilayer and multibilayer biological membranes with dimensions and number of bilayers predicted by the Janus compound concentration in water. The simple injection method of preparation is accessible without any special equipment, generating uniform vesicles, and thus provides a promising tool for fundamental studies as well as technological applications in nanomedicine and other fields.},
